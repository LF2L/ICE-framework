abstract = {Engaging users for co-creating alternative solutions and usage scenarios is, as revealed in previous studies, not so obvious. Very often, it necessitates expensive high-tech resources, such as a CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment), for setting-up an immersive environment in which all project stakeholders, especially users, would feel confortable enough for unleashing their valuable contribution. Our previous empirical study on low-cost immersive environments has unveiled the great potential of close-to-real-life immersion that fulfils the realism principle of a Living Lab facilitating users' contribution to alternative solutions and usage scenarios. However, this previous work had a limit of addressing individuals through their capacity of behaving naturally within different types of immersive platforms. As a step further, this paper presents the outcomes of an investigation to identifying and disentangling factors characterising a group immersion in the context of co-creation instead of an individual's immersion.},

abstract = {Meeting the Universe Halfway is an ambitious book with far-reaching implications for numerous fields in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. In this volume, Karen Barad, theoretical physicist and feminist theorist, elaborates her theory of agential realism. Offering an account of the world as a whole rather than as composed of separate natural and social realms, agential realism is at once a new epistemology, ontology, and ethics. The starting point for Barads analysis is the philosophical framework of quantum physicist Niels Bohr. Barad extends and partially revises Bohrs philosophical views in light of current scholarship in physics, science studies, and the philosophy of science as well as feminist, poststructuralist, and other critical social theories. In the process, she significantly reworks understandings of space, time, matter, causality, agency, subjectivity, and objectivity.In an agential realist account, the world is made of entanglements of social and natural agencies, where the distinction between the two emerges out of specific intra-actions. Intra-activity is an inexhaustible dynamism that configures and reconfigures relations of space-time-matter. In explaining intra-activity, Barad reveals questions about how nature and culture interact and change over time to be fundamentally misguided. And she reframes understanding of the nature of scientific and political practices and their interrelationship. Thus she pays particular attention to the responsible practice of science, and she emphasizes changes in the understanding of political practices, critically reworking Judith Butlers influential theory of performativity. Finally, Barad uses agential realism to produce a new interpretation of quantum physics, demonstrating that agential realism is more than a means of reflecting on science; it can be used to actually do science.},

abstract = {In this study, we focus on the factors that influence online innovation community members' continued participation in the context of open source software development (OSSD) communities. Prior research on continued participation in online communities has primarily focused on social interactions among members and benefits obtained from these interactions. However, members of these communities often play different roles, which have been examined extensively, albeit in a separate stream of research. This study attempts to bridge these two streams of research by investigating the joint influence of community response and members' roles on continued participation. We categorize OSSD community members into users and modifiers and empirically examine the differential effects of community response across these roles. By analyzing a longitudinal data set of activities in the discussion forums of more than 300 OSSD projects, we not only confirm the positive influence of community response on members' continued participation but also find that community response is more influential in driving the continuance behavior of users than that of modifiers. In addition, this research highlights the importance of modifiers, a key subgroup of OSSD participants that has been largely overlooked by prior research. {\textcopyright} 2013, INFORMS.},

@book{Latour2005,
abstract = {Reassembling the Social is a fundamental challenge from one of the world's leading social theorists to how we understand society and the 'social'. Bruno Latour's contention is that the word 'social', as used by Social Scientists, has become laden with assumptions to the point where it has become misnomer. When the adjective is applied to a phenomenon, it is used to indicate a stablilized state of affairs, a bundle of ties that in due course may be used to account for another phenomenon. But Latour also finds the word used as if it described a type of material, in a comparable way to an adjective such as 'wooden' or 'steely'. Rather than simply indicating what is already assembled together, it is now used in a way that makes assumptions about the nature of what is assembled. It has become a word that designates two distinct things: a process of assembling; and a type of material, distinct from others. Latour shows why 'the social' cannot be thought of as a kind of material or domain, and disputes attempts to provide a 'social explanations' of other states of affairs. While these attempts have been productive (and probably necessary) in the past, the very success of the social sciences mean that they are largely no longer so. At the present stage it is no longer possible to inspect the precise constituents entering the social domain. Latour returns to the original meaning of 'the social' to redefine the notion, and allow it to trace connections again. It will then be possible to resume the traditional goal of the social sciences, but using more refined tools. Drawing on his extensive work examining the 'assemblages' of nature, Latour finds it necessary to scrutinize thoroughly the exact content of what is assembled under the umbrella of Society. This approach, a 'sociology of associations', has become known as Actor-Network-Theory, and this book is an essential introduction both for those seeking to understand Actor-Network Theory, or the ideas of one of its most influential proponents.},

abstract = {The success of Wikipedia demonstrates that self-organizing production communities can produce high-quality information-based products. Research on Wikipedia has proceeded largely atheoretically, focusing on (1) the diversity in members' knowledge bases as a determinant of Wikipedia's content quality, (2) the task-related conflicts that occur during the collaborative authoring process, and (3) the different roles members play in Wikipedia. We develop a theoretical model that explains how these three factors interact to determine the quality of Wikipedia articles. The results from the empirical study of 96 Wikipedia articles suggest that (1) diversity should be encouraged, as the creative abrasion that is generated when cognitively diverse members engage in task-related conflict leads to higher-quality articles, (2) task conflict should be managed, as conflict-notwithstanding its contribution to creative abrasion-can negatively affect group output, and (3) groups should maintain a balance of both administrative- and content-oriented members, as both contribute to the collaborative process. {\textcopyright} 2011 M.E.

abstract = {The Anthropocene is a proposed new epoch to be added to the Geological Time Scale describing the very recent rupture in the functioning of the Earth System as a whole arising from the impact of human activity. The kinds of human activity capable of disrupting the Earth System have to be separated from those that merely alter the landscape or interfere in an ecosystem. The concept required the emergence of Earth System science in the 1980s and 1990s. Other scientific approaches have misconstrued it, often in debates over the new epoch's starting date. It involves the unique features of complex systems, and has been enriched by climate science. The idea of the Anthropocene has led to research integrating stratigraphy with Earth System science. Social scientists, noting the remarkable convergence of human and natural history in the Anthropocene, have advanced various critiques of the idea, most of them reflecting a deep epistemological divide over the nature and scope of kinds of knowledge. Humanists build on the science as given, while posthumanists view the Anthropocene as a vindication of their criticism of notions of human agency and Cartesian dualism. The critique of anthropocentrism is applied to the Anthropocene, both the term and even the â€˜objective' nature of it.},

Over the last years, however, but also of explosion of the so-called collaborative/sharing economy, timebanking has gain popularity, in context of crisis. The number of initiatives has experienced a peak and a new kind of TB has emerged, the Digital TB (DTB). This paper emerges from a transnational case study research. First, it proposes a classification of TBs. After that, it focuses on one DTB, TimeRepublik, before analysing the main similarities and differences between old and new TBs. Finally, it reflects about the role of digital technologies in the rejuvenation of an old idea such as time exchange. The main conclusions are that, despite sharing the hour per hour schema, DTBs' scope, members' profile and nature of the services exchanged bring along some limitations and challenges but also reveal a set of possibilities beyond the goals of traditional timebanking.},

We discuss three broad areas accessible to public participants that will accelerate research progress: label and ledger transcription, georeferencing from locality descriptions, and specimen annotation from images. We illustrate each activity, compare useful tools, present best practices and standards, and identify gaps in our knowledge and areas for improvement.

Through its ability to nurture trees, matsutake helps forests to grow in daunting places. It is also an edible delicacy in Japan, where it sometimes commands astronomical prices. In all its contradictions, matsutake offers insights into areas far beyond just mushrooms and addresses a crucial question: what manages to live in the ruins we have made? A tale of diversity within our damaged landscapes, The Mushroom at the End of the World follows one of the strangest commodity chains of our times to explore the unexpected corners of capitalism. Here, we witness the varied and peculiar worlds of matsutake commerce: the worlds of Japanese gourmets, capitalist traders, Hmong jungle fighters, industrial forests, Yi Chinese goat herders, Finnish nature guides, and more. These companions also lead us into fungal ecologies and forest histories to better understand the promise of cohabitation in a time of massive human destruction. By investigating one of the world's most sought-after fungi, The Mushroom at the End of the World presents an original examination into the relation between capitalist destruction and collaborative survival within multispecies landscapes, the prerequisite for continuing life on earth.},

Los movimientos internacionales feministas han construido la 'experiencia de las mujeres' y, asimismo, han destapado o descubierto este objeto colectivo crucial. Tal experiencia es una ficci{\'{o}}n y un hecho pol{\'{i}}tico de gran importancia. La liberaci{\'{o}}n se basa en la construcci{\'{o}}n de la conciencia, de la comprensi{\'{o}}n imaginativa de la opresi{\'{o}}n y, tambi{\'{e}}n, de lo posible. El ciborg es materia de ficci{\'{o}}n y experiencia viva que cambia lo que importa como experiencia de las mujeres a finales de este siglo. Se trata de una lucha a muerte, pero las fronteras entre ciencia ficci{\'{o}}n y realidad social son una ilusi{\'{o}}n {\'{o}}ptica.},

@article{Lovelock1974,
abstract = {During the time, 3.2 Ã— 109 years, that life has been present on Earth, the physical and chemical conditions of most of the planetary surface have never varied from those most favourable for life. The geological record reads that liquid water was always present and that the pH was never far from neutral. During this same period, however, the Earth's radiation environment underwent large changes. As the sun moved along the course set by the main sequence of stars its output will have increased at least 30{\%} and possibly 100{\%}. It may also have fluctuated in brightness over periods of a few million years. At the same time hydrogen was escaping to space from the Earth and so causing progressive changes in the chemical environment. This in turn through atmospheric compositional changes could have affected the Earth's radiation balance. It may have been that these physical and chemical changes always by blind chance followed the path whose bounds are the conditions favouring the continued existence of life. This paper offers an alternative explanation that, early after life began it acquired control of the planetary environment and that this homeostasis by and for the biosphere has persisted ever since. Historic and contemporary evidence and arguments for this hypothesis will be presented.},
