The Immersive Collaborative Environments framework was developed by [@Pallot2017b], [@Dupont2018a] and it can be use that could be used in investigations of Immersive and Collaborative performances.

This site was created as a companion site to the paper **Digital Collaborations for the Common Good: Key Learnings from Four Community Projects** presented at the session [Co-Creation, Open Design, Digital Collaboration, Virtual Community](https://designascommongood.ch/day-1/diverse-open-collaborative-innovative-approaches-to-design) of the [Design as Common Good](https://designascommongood.ch) 2021 symposium of the Swiss Design Network.

The site is an invitation to use discussed framework in further analysis of digital mediated collaborations.
