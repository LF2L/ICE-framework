      "contents": "\nAnalyzing digital mediated collaborations\nWe are concerned with how to make people collaborate in digital platforms, how to raise empathy, how to create, motivate or manage initiatives, how to encourage responsibility to engage people with problems.\nTo investigate this, in the paper Digital Collaborations for the Common Good: Key Learnings from Four Community Projects we analyzed four digital collaborative projects found in the literature to understand how the collaboration is mediated and to examine their opportunities and challenges.\nThe analysis of the cases was done through the lenses of a theoretical framework for collaboration in immersive environments which helps us to better understand the different factors affecting the collaboration. Revealing how those factors play a role in each case allows us to understand how to encourage and facilitate digital collaborations.\nThe model\nThe ICE (Immersive collaborative environment) model was made to conceptualize and measure collaborations mediated by immersive environments and thus digital technologies.\nThe model was proposed by (Dupont et al. 2018),(Dupont et al. 2017),(Pallot et al. 2017) and its composed by two main parts, one concerned with immersion and the other with collaboration; is mainly the latter we are going to discuss here .\nICE Tree StructureThe collaborative experience\nFor the collaboration component the model proposes four elements, each of them with two properties: Sense Making (SMa): Relevance (SmaR), Context Awareness (SMCA);\nTrust Building (TB): Interpersonal Ties (TBIT), Confidence (TBC);\nShared Meanings (SMe): Knowledge Sharing (SMEKS), Knowledge Creation (SMeKC);\nMutual Understanding (MU): Group Dynamics (MUGD), Collective Intelligence (MUCI).\nThe slides of the talk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDupont, Laurent, Marc Pallot, Olivier Christmann, and Simon Richir. 2018. “A Universal Framework For Systemizing the Evaluation of Immersive And Collaborative Performance.” In Proceedings of the Virtual Reality International Conference - Laval Virtual, 1–10.
